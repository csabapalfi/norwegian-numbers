# Norwegian number formatting

Norway used to use the `no` (Norwegian) language code that's considered legacy now. [ISO_639-1]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) considered it macrolanguage.

The new language code(s) are `nb` (Bokm√•l) and `nn` (Nynorsk) as per Norway's offical languages.

[icu4c aliases `no` to `nb`](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/master/icu4c/source/data/lang/no.txt). It does the same to `no-NO` as well.

Node.js uses icu4c data but even with `full-icu` it seems to ignore the icu4c alias for number formatting. (Maybe all aliases are ignored?).
